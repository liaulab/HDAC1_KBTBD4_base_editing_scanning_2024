# HDAC1_KBTBD4_base_editing_scanning_2024
Repository containing code used to analyze base-editing screens in the preprint [Asymmetric Engagement of Dimeric CRL3^KBTBD4 by the Molecular Glue UM171 Licenses Degradation of HDAC1/2 Complexes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.593897v1.full).

## Repository Contents
1. Code to analyze CRISPR suppressor scanning: script to process and normalize sgRNA counts from fastqs, resulting in values used in the paper (analyze_screen_data.ipynb)
2. Code to generate linear clustering analysis: script to find stretches of residues that significantly enrich (analyze_linear_clustering.ipynb)

## Code to analyze CRISPR suppressor scanning: analyze_screen_data.ipynb
- sgRNA library designed using [base editor design tool](https://github.com/mhegde/base-editor-design-tool). Code might be non-generalizable in areas where this input comes into play but can be easily modified if using another design tool.
- Code for counting sgRNAs occurence also hardcodes 'CGAAACACCG' key, which assumes usage of standard overhangs in CRISPR sgRNA cloning
- Code for counting sgRNAs occurence is modified from and indebted to [this script](https://github.com/liaulab/DNMT1_eLife_2022/blob/main/Figure%201/DNMT1_Figure1_screen_analysis_functions.py)

## Code to generate linear clustering analysis: analyze_linear_clustering.ipynb
- This script takes input from the df generated by analyze_screen_data.ipynb. If different base editors were used (i.e. both ABE and CBE), sgRNA scores were z-scored so that results from both screens can be combined. This script is modified from and indebted to [this script](https://github.com/liaulab/DNMT1_eLife_2022/blob/main/Figure%202/DNMT1_Figure2_analysis_functions.py)
